# Hands-On AI: Building RAG Solutions with Azure AI Foundry
This hands-on course is designed to equip you with the skills to design, build, and evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using Azure and OpenAI technologies. You'll begin by gaining a foundational understanding of how RAG works and the key components of its architecture. As the course progresses, you'll dive into the practical aspects of creating content filters and deploying models, and explore how these elements enhance the performance and relevance of your RAG solutions.

You'll also learn how to create and configure indexes using Azure AI Search to efficiently retrieve contextually relevant data. Using the OpenAI Python SDK and Azure AI Foundry, you will build and evaluate a fully functional RAG application. The course also introduces Chainlit as a lightweight and effective way to deploy your RAG solution with an interactive interface.

Finally, put your knowledge to the test in an end-of-course project where you’ll build and present your own complete RAG application. By the end of the course, you’ll have both the theoretical understanding and practical experience to confidently implement RAG systems in real-world scenarios.
